# What are the possibilities of an recognized pattern?




a) There is a single occurrence possible. For example bombs of one kind (quadruplets or single colored straights)

b) In the general case a pattern is usually not unique by itself. For example: tuple is also present if it is actually a triple,
   a straight can be longer than the needed length, a full house can be built with different tuples without even changing its height.

Now what is important to know in order to justify the probability?

## Protocol between Player and Server

* Should the player directly give a pattern or just a bunch of cards?
  The logic of recognizing patterns must be implemented anyways.

* Pro "Cards Only":

  * Simplicity of the protocol
  * The server needs to check the validity anyways
  
* Pro "Patterns":
  
  * Logic of Patterns is already available for AI logic
  * ?
